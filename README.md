Diffusion model test data

- Oxide and nitride tests: All data correspond to VASP-relaxed structures and their associated hull energies.

- GNoME test: All data correspond to 7net-relaxed structures and their associated hull energies. DFT calculations are performed when the predicted structure is more than 50 meV per atom more stable than the corresponding GNoME structure, and the resulting energies and structures are shown in Figure 3 of the manuscript.
